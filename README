rLedes
=====

rLedes is a Ledes file parser for Ruby.  Right now, it is a Rails plugin only.  It's also quite in beta and lots of functionality is missing.  Run the Rspec tests with rake spec:plugins with your Rails tests. If you wanna be super cool, add to them :)

Example
=======

@ledes = Ledes::LedesFile.new('path_to_ledes_file')
@ledes.line_items # the line items in the invoice
@ledes.fields # the fields in the ledes file (columns)
@ledes.line_items.first.line_type # the line type, ie, EXP/FEE/INV_ADJ_TYPE
